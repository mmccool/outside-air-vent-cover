# Outside Air Vent Cover
Cover for outside air vent to protect it from rain and control draft volume.
For use with pellet stove.  Note 3D printed parts cannot be used with hot air but this
will be used on an inlet which is at ambient temperatures.  However, it will be 
subject to the weather as well as sunlight (and UV) and so should be printed with an
outdoor-rated plastic such as UV-stabilized ASA.
It is also designed to fit over an existing cover.
